Power is supplied to the sensors, arduino, motors and drivers. 
The brain of the system is arduino which interfaces with rosserial through 
which commands are given to the ros drivers. The drivers in turn give an input
to the motors which drives the motor controllers and controls the robotic arm.
The feebcak from the arm is sent back to the arduino and the cycle goes on

Existing robots do not cater for floor to floor movements. For enabling
the robot to move between floors we use two methods for the arm to press 
the buttons:
1)by making the robot press the elevator button that looks similar
 to the image that has been input.
2)by calculating the distance from the top of the ground to the first 
button on the elevator and the distance between each button on the elevator.
the distance can be mapped for the arm to press a specific button
